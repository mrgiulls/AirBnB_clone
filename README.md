### Descripci√≥n
***
__Airbnb__ is an online platform that connects people who have a home to offer, with people who need a place to stay temporarily.

This is the first phase of an eight phase project, where we create The AirBnB Clone and create a shell to manage the AirBnB objects.

This Phase of the project focuses on everything about Python:
`Import`,` Exceptions`, `Class`, `Private attribute`, `Getter / Setter`, `Class method`, `Static method`, `Inheritance`, `Unittest`, `Read / Write file`, `args `and` kwargs`, `Serialization` / `Deserialization` and `JSON`.

Phases of the AirBnB clone project:
1. **The console**
