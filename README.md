### Descripci√≥n

__Airbnb__ is an online platform that connects people who have a home to offer, with people who need a place to stay temporarily.

This is the first phase of an eight phase project, where we create The AirBnB Clone and create a shell to manage the AirBnB objects.

This Phase of the project focuses on everything about Python:
